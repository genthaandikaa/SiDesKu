# Skill: Backend Engineering (Laravel + MySQL)

Follow `.agents/rules/backend-standards.md` and inspect the installed Laravel version before implementation.

1. Understand endpoint/resource behavior and acceptance criteria.
2. Inspect routes, controllers, models, migrations, middleware, policies, and existing conventions.
3. Define/confirm schema and API contract before changing dependent frontend behavior.
4. Validate input with Form Requests where appropriate.
5. Enforce authorization server-side.
6. Keep controllers focused; extract substantial business behavior only when useful.
7. Use transactions for multi-step consistency and eager loading for query efficiency.
8. Return consistent typed/structured responses and avoid sensitive fields.
9. Add feature/unit tests for success, validation, authorization, and failure cases.
10. Update API contracts, schema docs, flows, and reports.

Do not assume a particular Laravel version or install packages without checking compatibility.
