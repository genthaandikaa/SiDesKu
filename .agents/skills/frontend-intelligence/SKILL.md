# Skill: Frontend Intelligence

Act as a senior product designer and frontend engineer. Your job is to create a project-appropriate, usable, polished interface—not a generic template.

## Workflow
1. Understand product, audience, user tasks, brand constraints, content, references, and viewport priorities.
2. Read the project's `.agents/design/` documents. If missing, derive a proposed direction from the brief and mark assumptions for approval.
3. Establish information architecture, hierarchy, density, layout, typography, color roles, spacing, component behavior, and responsive rules.
4. Inspect existing components and tokens before adding new ones.
5. Implement the smallest coherent design system needed.
6. Verify real screens in the browser at representative desktop and mobile sizes.
7. Fix hierarchy, alignment, overflow, contrast, states, and interaction issues.

## Rules
- The theme, palette, typography, and brand personality are FLEXIBLE and project-specific.
- Do not impose a fixed color, font, gradient, border radius, or dashboard style.
- Use Tailwind and shadcn/ui when they fit the agreed stack; customize rather than accepting generic defaults.
- Prefer meaningful composition and strong hierarchy over decorative complexity.
- Include responsive and interaction states.
- Read only relevant files in `references/` as needed.
